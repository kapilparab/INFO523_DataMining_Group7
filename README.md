# Dataset

The dataset was downloaded from [nhtsa.gov](https://www.nhtsa.gov/research-data/fatality-analysis-reporting-system-fars).

Our dataset has been derived from Fatality Analysis Reporting System (FARS) system and the Crash Report Sampling System (CRSS), maintained by the National Highway Trafﬁc Safety Administration (NHTSA) of the United States.

These systems collect and analyze motor vehicle trafﬁc crash data to enhance road safety, reduce injuries, and prevent fatalities on the trafﬁcways.

Dataset documentation can be found in ```data/raw/``` directory.
